EditMesh
========

Edit mesh is not pretty, it's buggy, it doesn't have a cool name, 
but it's what I use every day to deal with meshes. It does tricks 
that no other app can do. I love it.

For example, EditMesh can render your meshes using a nice toon shader, like this:

And it can deform your meshes in real time using a universal stereographic transformation, mercator transformation or sinusoidal transformation. Here's an example of the universal stereographic one:
